# SKK_Keymap_L2X

## Features
* It is set to use l by disabling the one that uses x in romaji.
* Use x to switch to alphabetic characters.
* It's easy, but I have an installation script. Copy only the files you need to `$HOME/.config/libskk/rules/`.
* The basic settings use [ueno/libskk](https://github.com/ueno/libskk) default and Sticky Shift.

## Install
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/yasunori-kirin0418/SKK_Keymap_L2X.git
cd SKK_Keymap_L2X
bash ./install.sh
```
